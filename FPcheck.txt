Many people long to win the lottery and enjoy the trappings of wealth. But for one woman, securing a job at the Pokemon Centre in Japan would be her dream come true. Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia of all shapes and sizes. Lisa's mother had to move to the smallest room in the house to make room for her daughter's collection . Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia . Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother  had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. Lisa Courtney searches for Pokemon items online at her home . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life. For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme helped her through a very difficult stage of her life . 'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' Sharon Courtney said she did not mind moving to a smaller bedroom as Pokemon was so important to her daughter. 'I love Pokemon now. It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales  hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for £60 online. 'I will always collect Pokemon, here's always something new to get. 'For me, Pokemon is like an additional family - it always lifts my spirits.' Watch Collectaholics on BBC iPlayer.

Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women. Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women . The new powers, approved by Deputy Premier and Planning Minister Jackie Trad, means there is now an official and legal definition of a party house so the council can enforce laws to shut them down in certain areas. If an illegal party house is reported to the council, authorities will be able to force the owner of the property to apply for a development application. If they refuse the council can legally shut them down. Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events like Bucks parties. Police have often been called in after neighbours complained about noise and lewd behaviour at some of the houses across the Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Mermaid Waters and Surfers Paradise areas. Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers . There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence . Some residents who live near a party house have said they are afraid to leave their homes while a weekend-long party is raging and are tormented by the noise and activities next door. Burleigh councillor Greg Betts told the Gold Coast Bulletin the crackdown would begin this month. 'This is a planning issue which means that the criteria of what is allowed to be a party house is strict and those people operating them will have to apply to have this status,' he said. 'If they fail to get this approval but continue to operate we can shut them down.' The former state government introduced new laws last year allowing council to institute 'party house restriction areas' where short-term rental properties will be forbidden from operating.

Jodie Bredo, 26, from Essex, has been a Kate lookalike for six years and wishes the Duchess of Cambridge would 'change her hair for once' - suggesting she opt for a bob style. Jodie, who is now single after splitting from her boyfriend, said of the Duchess, who is expecting her second child: 'Kate’s just too frumpy for her age. Scroll down for video . She often does jobs with a Prince William lookalike (left) but says she fancies the younger Prince Harry more . Jodie Bredo, 26, (pictured) has been a professional Kate Middleton lookalike for the past six years . 'I know I'm seven years younger than her but she should dress more fun. I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off. I’d love her to get something more fashionable like a bob.' Miss Bredo admits she does not fancy Prince William and is not tempted to have her own happy ending like the royal couple. She said: 'I do lots of jobs with a William lookalike, but I don’t see him like that. Prince Harry's the better one. His bad boy image is more for me.' Although her counterpart is in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London currently awaiting her second child, Miss Bredo is not keen to start a family herself. The glamorous Essex resident said: 'I've recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend so I’m not thinking about babies. 'Kate’s new baby isn’t making me broody,' said the lookalike (with her nephew Louis). 'I've got two nephews and one's the same age as Prince George - but it’s nice to hand them back to their mum at the end' 'I know I’m seven years younger than her but she should dress more fun,' said Miss Bredo (left). 'I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off' 'Kate’s new baby isn’t making me broody. I’ve got two nephews and one's the same age as Prince George - but it’s nice to hand them back to their mum at the end.' Miss Bredo started her career after noticing her resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge. She was routinely stopped in the street when Kate first came into the public eye while dating Prince William. She said: 'I was shopping in Debenhams with my mum when this woman came running after us. 'I thought I’d left something, but she just said, "I have to tell you, you look so much after Kate Middleton." 'Even at the opticians having my eyes tested, the optometrist told me I looked like her. Miss Bredo (left, with her mum and sister) began her career after people kept commenting on her likeness to Kate Middleton . She sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009 and was hired for a shoot in Tatler . 'My family were on holiday in Cyprus and Kate was in the newspaper. My mum told me I looked like her and needed to do something with it.' Miss Bredo sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009. She said: 'I was accepted but didn’t hear from them about any jobs. I wasn’t too bothered. I was working as a personal assistant at the time and didn’t think about it. 'In March 2009, I had a call from them saying I had my first job. When they said it was for Tatler magazine, I couldn’t believe it. 'I took the day off and had to go to Aintree races, the shoot was based around what they thought Kate should be wearing. I was in these mad outfits. 'This one dress had plastic panelling all down the arms so I couldn't even move my arm to have a drink.' After the royal couple’s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo (third from left) began working as a lookalike full-time . After the royal couple’s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo began working as a lookalike full-time. She said: 'I had so many calls I was doing four to five days a week, appearing at corporate events and doing shoots. 'It was really strange, people wanting a picture with me, but I got into it and really had fun.' Miss Bredo studies Kate’s mannerisms as well as following her beauty regime. She said: 'I have regular trims to keep my hair looking good, every two months and curl the ends the same as Kate. 'Her signature look is a lot of black eyeliner so I get through that really quickly. 'I spend £30 a month buying black eyeliner. My favourite brand is Bare Minerals. She has regular trims to keep her hair in good shape, spends £30 a month on black eyeliner, has regular manicures and buys clothes that are distinctly 'Kate' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George last year, Miss Bredo (middle) has had plenty of shoots with tots and has even has to wear a baby bump . 'She also wears very harsh blusher and has natural nails so I give myself regular manicures.' Miss Bredo spends hours searching for the Duchess on the internet so she can keep up-to-date with her wardrobe. She said: 'If she’s wearing something new, I’ll try and find it but it’s usually sold out instantly. 'I know what kind of clothes she’ll wear now. 'When I’m going clothes shopping I’ll choose some things that I think are "Kate." 'I picked up this black and white spotted dress and my mum didn't think it was something the Duchess of Cambridge would wear. 'Then I saw a picture of her when she was pregnant with George – it was the same one I’d bought. 'I think she’s copying me now.' Kate Middleton (pictured in London on 12 March) is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William any day now . Miss Bredo usually appears with a William lookalike and their after-work drinks get plenty of attention. She said: 'You can tell people are staring and some people take sneaky pictures of us. 'But a lot of people come up and ask to take a picture, it’s funny we’re just two friends having a drink. 'Even on my own I get lots of double takes – especially if I’m in London.' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George, aged one, Miss Bredo has had plenty of shoots with tots. She said: 'I’ve got used to holding babies now and when I do events they provide me with a bump. 'I’m looking to forward to losing that now she’s having the baby.'

Kim Kardashian has launched an outspoken attack on President Obama for refusing to use the word 'genocide' as he marked the 100th anniversary of the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians. The reality star said it was 'very disappointing' that he stopped short of using the word - which he had promised to use when he ran for office. Kardashian, whose Armenian heritage comes from her father, the late Robert Kardashian, has used her celebrity since  2011 to bring awareness to the genocide. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder at the weekend, Kardashian wrote in an op-ed in Time magazine: 'I would like President Obama to use the word "genocide". It’s very disappointing he hasn’t used it as President. 'We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we’re close — but we’re definitely moving in the right direction. ' Scroll down for video . Kim and Khloe Kardashian laid flowers at the Dzidzernagapert Armenian genocide monument’s eternal flame during their April 10 visit. Marking the anniversary of the mass murder last weekend, Kim Kardashian wrote in an op-ed, 'I would like President Obama to use the word “genocide.” It’s very disappointing he hasn’t used it as President' Tricky language: President Barack Obama sent an administration official to Armenia to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1915 massacre by Ottoman Turks. But he refused to call the mass killings of ethnic Armenians a 'genocide' for fear of offending ally Turkey . Slaughter: Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War I. Above, Armenians are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre . Kim and Khloe walk in the plaza at the Armenian Genocide Memorial. They were accompanied by their cousins Kara and Kourtni and Kim's husband Kanye West. Kim and Khloe's  Armenian heritage comes from their father, the late Robert Kardashian . As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama did describe the killings of Armenians as genocide. But he has never used that description since taking office, mainly out of deference to Turkey, a key U.S. partner. The White House said U.S. officials pledged to Armenian-American leaders that the U.S. would use last week's 100th anniversary of the killings 'to urge a full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts,' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word 'genocide.' Historians estimate up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks, an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide. Turkey, however, denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic-driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff also said he was 'deeply disappointed' by the president's decision. 'The United States has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights, for speaking out against atrocity, for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others,' said Schiff. 'This cannot be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or Congress.' Kardashian, who recently traveled to the country for the first time with her husband Kanye West, sister Khloe and cousins Kara and Kourtni Kardashian, said, 'Now is the time to speak out, and every little bit helps' 'I will continue to ask the questions and fight for the genocide to be recognized for what it was,' the reality television star said, encouraging Turkey to label the killings as a genocide. 'It’s not the fault of the people who live there now, ' she noted, and 'I think if they recognize it and acknowledge it, everyone can move on. 'I believe in moving on and looking toward a brighter future, but you can’t move on unless you acknowledge the past. To not do so is an act of disrespect.' Paying their respects: Kim has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011. The Pope has also called the slaughter 'the first genocide of the 20th century' Kim and Kanye are pictured here with daughter North West and Khloe as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at Cathedral of Sts. James in the historic Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem last year for Norrie's christening . Kardashian recalled in the op-ed that her family tree would have ended if her grandparents hadn't left Armenia for Los Angeles the year before the armed conflict. 'There are so many people who lost their families, and the stories of how they were killed are so heartbreaking—they should never be forgotten,' she wrote. 'The whole point of remembering the genocide is to make sure it doesn’t happen again. A million-and-a-half people were brutally massacred, and a country can just pretend like it never happened? I don’t think that’s right.' While in Armenia, Kardashian and her family visited the Dzidzernagapert Armenian Genocide monument’s eternal flame that honors those countryman who were killed in 1915. 'An emotional day at the genocide museum,' read a tweet posted by Kim that was accompanied by a photo of her and Khloe laying flowers at the flame. Kardashian has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011, when she wrote in a blog post, 'Every year, I honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Even though so many countries around the world recognize the Genocide, the government of Turkey still denies it. 'It happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust. Maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.' During their trip to her ancestors' homeland, Kim, Khloe and their cousins met with the country's Prime Minister, Hovik Abrahamyan, who 'expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots!' Kim said in a tweet. Kim's husband Kanye also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in Yerevan at Swan Lake before departing Armenia for Jerusalem, Israel - the location of their daughter's christening at an Armenian church in 2014. The Kardashians also visited the Geghard Monastery during their trip to Armenia . Khloe wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial: 'My sister and I are trying to bring awareness not only to our Armenian genocide but genocides and human slaughter, in general. Knowledge is power!' 'The Kardashians have helped strike a powerful blow at Turkey's campaign of genocide denial,' ANCA communications director told ABC News after the visit. Their trip to Armenia 'has helped shine a global spotlight' on the genocide and 'the need for justice for that crime with millions,' she said. Khloe also kept the campaign going after she returned home, asking her fan base on Twitter to sign a Change.org petition 'to bring awareness to the Armenian genocide' by requesting that Google highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings, April 24. 'I did!!!' she said. As of Friday  the online petition had garnered more than 202,129 supporters, beating its goal of 200,000 names. Google did not wade in the controversy by adopting the suggested doodle, however. The White House said last week that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from Obama this year, the administration believes its approach is right, 'both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.' It announced at the same time that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew would attend a ceremony in Armenia on Friday making the anniversary. 'President Obama's surrender to Turkey represents a national disgrace,' Armenian National Committee of America Chairman (ANCA) Ken Hachikian said in a statement. 'It is, very simply, a betrayal of truth, a betrayal of trust.' The Pope added his name this year to the list of high-profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the 'first genocide of the 20th Century.' He further proclaimed that 'concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.' Ties that bind: The Kardashian family tree that traces back to two Molokan Armenian families . Home: Kim Kardashian's ancient ancestors fled the Armenian village Karakale (pictured recently) to escape a prophecised genocide that DID come to pass . Genocide: The village of Karakale (pictured in the 19th Century) was among hundreds destroyed as the Ottoman Empire laid waste to the region. Residents - possibly including the Kardashians - can be seen standing by their traditional houses . Disputed: Armenian lands (in red) were disputed just after the turn of the 20th Century, with bloody consequences . Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide. Turkey rejects the claims, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops. The fundamental division was religious. Armenians are Christians, while Turks are Muslims. The two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years, but the Ottoman Turks had always been on top. As Ottoman rule crumbled, rival nationalisms arose, and the Russian Empire - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded. Armenians say they were forced from their homes, marched to mass graves and slaughtered. Some managed to flee south into modern-day Syria and the Levant, others to Russian-held land which is now modern-day Armenia. Hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled. The outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed. But the use of the word 'genocide' is hugely controversial, as Turkey - successor to the Ottoman empire, and with a huge majority of Muslim ethnic Turks - rejects the description. Armenia, which became a fully-fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the Soviet Union, has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths. Its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred. The province of Kars (above), where the Kardashians' roots - and the origin of their name - lies, is almost entirely in Turkey. Its capital, Kars, is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries: it sits on the border but the frontier is closed.

Pet aquarium fish are being dumped in rivers where they damage unique local ecosystems by growing up to twenty times their regular size. Goldfish are being caught weighing up to 2kg and koi carp up to 8kg and one metre in length, in the waterways of Western Australia amongst other exotic introduced species. 'A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish, so they prey on them and compete for habitat,' Dr David Morgan, the Director of the Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research at Murdoch University, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Goldfish (pictured) weighing up to 2kg are some of the exotic aquarium fish invading and destroying WA's waterways . Koi carp (pictured) weighing up to 8kg and up to one metre in length are another of the 13 introduced pests . The native fish in the region, such as this Balston's Pygmy Perch which has been attacked, are only up 10cm . 'Our native fish are generally less than 10cm in length like the pygmy perch or the native minnows. 'In the south-west of Western Australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there, so the rivers are refuges for the native fish and when they are forced to coexist with introduced species, they just don't do very well.' Aside from feasting on local fish and taking their homes, introduced species are also bringing exotic parasites and disease with them. 'In Perth we're aware of a couple of parasites. One is pretty devastating on native fish, it's an anchor worm which is a little crustacean that leaves a hideous, hideous impact on native fish and was probably introduced by goldfish. A huge Murray River Cod was removed from a Perth wetland in Novemeber last year: 'A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish, so they prey on them and compete for habitat,' Dr David Morgan, the Director of the Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research at Murdoch University, said . Pest carps: 'In the south-west of Western Australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there,' he added . 'We've now found it in three rivers around Perth and south of Perth. 'It's been only in the last decade that we've discovered a lot of parasites and disease that we don't know a lot about - there's a lot of things that have come in to Australia that we really don't know anything about.' Research conducted by Dr Morgan and Stephen Beatty found that at least 13 species of fish had been introduced into south-western Australia, with pet owners believed to be the biggest culprits. In 2012, the world's biggest ever specimen of a South American cichlid was found living in WA. 'Goldfish in captivity generally remain orange, grow to about 10-15 cm and weigh less than 100g – in the wild in WA they get to 2KG and 40cm,' Dr Morgan said . Pet owners who have dumped their aquarium fish in rivers are the culprits behind the invasion . In 2012, the world's biggest ever specimen of a South American cichlid (pictured) was found living in WA . 'Effectively people are unknowingly doing it - or occasionally they deliberately do it for fish to catch - but they're basically released by pet owners, so people aren't really aware what damage they're going to have in the ecosystem,' Dr Morgan said. 'What you see up and down Western Australia's coast is a lot of pest fishes are right in town centres and almost every town has one.' The problem is not unique to Australia. Many countries with Mediterranean climates have also had their waterways invaded by aquarium fish which, due to being extremely easy to breed, take off when in the wild. 'Education is our best solution, once fish get in the waterways they're extremely difficult to eradicate,' Dr Morgan, whose organisation euthanizes hundreds of the pests after catching them through electric fishing, said.
